# JavaScript crash course for Java developers

This is a free e-book.


Santa is not watching. Honestly.

Most materials available on the web either start from the very basics, oriented on beginners with no prior programming experience at all. Advanced courses imply experience in JavaScript itself.

In this course I'll try to give an introduction into JavaScript in terms of things known to Java developers. If you worked in other typed language like C# or C/C++, the course might still be useful for you.
